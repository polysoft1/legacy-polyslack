# PolySlack Dependencies
This file is intended to keep track of the dependencies that this project uses.

# Format
Each dependency should start with a level 1 header with the name of the dependency (\#Dependency)

Under that header, there should be 3 level 2 headers, one saying what license each dependency has (with a link to it), one for explaining the purpose of the dependency, and the other to explain license obligations (if any). (\#\#License, \#\#Purpose and \#\#Obligations).
